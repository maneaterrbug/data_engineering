#Project Proposal
Matt Ryan

For the data engineering module, I plan on using the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) to revisit the project I did during our supervised learning/classification module with a refreshable data pipeline. However, whereas in my previous project I used e-sports League of Legends data to attempt to predict the probability for a team to win based on the current game's gamestate, in this project I intend to use general player-base game data to design a statistical dashboard as well as a recommender system that classifies players on playstyles and recommends champions or characters they might like to play as.

An MVP for this project would be to build out the data pipeline using the Riot API and the statistical dashboard. If I have enough time following pipeline creation, I will try to look into a recommender system.
